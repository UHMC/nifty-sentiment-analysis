                This is an intermediate to advanced assignment distilled into a step-by-step with room to improve. A student familiar with the frameworks involved may finish in a day or less, while others may need to spend more time researching. A good working knowledge is well-earned and allows intuitive tuning of hyperparameters and potential implementations of more advanced mechanisms (RNNs, LSTMs, etc.) to improve performance.
