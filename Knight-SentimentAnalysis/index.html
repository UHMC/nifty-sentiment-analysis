<p>Sentiment Analysis may be performed as an application of Machine Learning (ML) to large bodies of text, such as those found in large consumer review datasets, in order to determine sentiment (positive, negative, sarcastic, etc.) and gain feedback. The use of Machine Learning techniques in this endeavor allows for much larger quantities of data to be processed than would be practical for human evaluators working directly with the data. With recent advances in Machine Learning in the form of new and powerful frameworks, it is relatively simple to set up a machine to perform analysis on text in a way previously confined to the domain of common-sense, human interpretation of opinions, feelings, etc.</p>

<ol>
  <li>If not already present, you will need to install Python (3.x preferred) and TensorFlow (GPU version recommended but not required).
    <ul>
      <li>https://www.python.org/downloads/</li>
      <li>https://www.tensorflow.org/install/</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Select one or more datasets to train on from any source available. The goal is to find a mapping from pieces of text to a kind of sentiment (binary [0 negative, 1 positive] is ideal). The IMDb, Amazon, and Yelp review datasets are a great choice.
    <ul>
      <li>http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/</li>
      <li>https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/readme.html</li>
      <li>https://www.yelp.com/dataset</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Massage the datasets into a consistent format so that your program may easily read them in (e.g. datum<tab>label<newline>).</newline></tab></li>
  <li>Load in the datasets (data and labels) from the massaged data/label files.</li>
  <li>Separate and store the data and labels into arrays, (or other appropriate data type).</li>
  <li>Optionally make helper functions to clean up the data for use (remove artifacts such as numeric codes and the like) (note: this can be part of massaging/preparation).</li>
  <li>Build your neural net model.
    <ol>
      <li>A relatively straightforward word2vec based approach may use the Keras library (included with TensorFlow). To do so, you will need to create a unique vocabulary list from the data (pieces of text) and associate each word in the vocabulary list with a numeric ID (the index of the word in the final list/array should work fine). Also consider including a special value for unknown words (words not present in the vocabulary list) that may be encountered when you attempt inference on arbitrary input.</li>
      <li>Prepare data and labels for training: encode the text data into numeric IDs and pad the sequences (each sentence or so) so they all have the same length (Keras has helper functions for this).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Train your model.</li>
  <li>Make a function to use your model for inference on input.</li>
  <li>Test it out on some arbitrary statements with known or intended sentiment.</li>
  <li>Play around with hyperparameters to see if you can improve performance accuracy.</li>
  <li>Add fancy graphics (e.g. for training/validation) if you’re into that.</li>
</ol>

<p>Data used for this assignment may vary, but for a successful attempt at inference on sentiments, datasets which are used should be well curated and have many examples for the neural net model to learn from. Some examples are the IMDb, Amazon, and Yelp reviews datasets. The <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/marklvl/sentiment-labelled-sentences-data-set/version/2#">datasets</a> included in this assignment are a combination of those, which was originally for a paper by Kotzias et. al.</p>

<p>Upon successful completion of this assignment, the student’s program should demonstrate reasonable accuracy in determining the sentiment (positive, negative) of a statement similar to those used in the training datasets. Getting far enough to perform any inference at all, whether or not it is accurate, still demonstrates a level of competence in file input/output, string parsing, mapping of one datatype to another using arrays or other data types, use of third-party frameworks, and a reasonable effort. In some cases, all that is necessary to improve performance is the tuning of the neural network model hyperparameters (number of hidden neurons, dimensionality of word embeddings, etc.).</p>
